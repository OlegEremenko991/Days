# Days 2.1
This is my pet project.
The app uses Realm to store your data and shows how many days passed after something happened in your life.
VIPER-based architecture.

## What you can do with this app

1. Create records with "+" button
2. Sort records with top left button
3. Save records with "Save" button (record name must contain at least 1 letter)
4. See how many days ago the recorded event took place
5. Remove records with a swipe
