# Days 2.1
This is my first own project. The app uses Realm to store your data and shows how many days passed after something happened in your life.

## What you can do with this app

1. Create records with "+" button
2. Save records with "Save" button (record name must contain at least 1 letter, otherwise "Save" button will not be active)
3. See how many days ago the recorded event took place
4. Remove records with a swipe
